	abstract = {In this work, we consider the design of a geometric multigrid method with multiplicative Schwarz smoothers for the eddy-current problem and the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The main purpose is to show numerically that a straightforward application works for the former problem, but not for the latter. The well-known key is a special decomposition of the function spaces within the multigrid algorithm. The failures and performance are shown with the help of a numerical test, implemented in the modern finite element library deal.II, including a github link to the eddy-current implementation.}

abstract = {Phase-field methods have the potential to simulate large scale evolution of networks of fractures in porous media without the need to explicitly track interfaces. Practical field simulations require however that robust and efficient decoupling techniques can be applied for solving these complex systems. In this work, we focus on the mechanics-step that involves the coupling of elasticity and the phase-field variable. We develop a multirate scheme in which a coarser time grid is employed for the mechanics equation (i.e., the displacements) and a finer time grid is taken for the phase-field problem. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated for two test cases.}

The phase-field fracture problem is formulated in a quasi-monolithic approach resulting in a nonlinear forward problem. The optimization problem is formulated within a reduced approach, where the state variable is eliminated. To this end, a globalized reduced Newton algorithm is employed. Our algorithmic developments are substantiated with a numerical example.},
